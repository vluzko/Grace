# Grace
[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) represents the first real opportunity to replace Javascript. Grace aims to be the first *high-level* language compiling to WebAssembly.

Grace mostly draws inspiration from Python and Haskell.

## Core Features
* Garbage collection
* Gradual typing
* A relatively rich type system (possibly Scala based, the exact details are being decided)
    * We're of the opinion that OOP is a *requirement* for any language aiming to reach widespread usage, so we will have to make concessions in the type system to that.
