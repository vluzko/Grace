# Grace
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/vluzko/Grace.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/vluzko/Grace)

[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) represents the first real opportunity to replace Javascript.

Grace mostly draws inspiration from Python and Haskell.

## Core Features
* Garbage collection
* Gradual typing
* A relatively rich type system (possibly Scala based, the exact details are being decided)
    * We're of the opinion that OOP (or something like that) is a *requirement* for any language aiming to reach widespread usage, so we will have to make concessions in the type system.
