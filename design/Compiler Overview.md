# Compiler Overview

The overall architecture can be represented as:

Code -> AST -> Control-Flow Graph -> Low Level Representation -> Bytecode

## AST
The AST is generated by the parser. It is more-or-less an exact representation of the code, without modification or optimization.

## Context Resolution

## Control-Flow Graph

### Optimization

## Low-Level Representation
The low-level representation is essentially just WebAssembly.

### Optimization

## Bytecode
