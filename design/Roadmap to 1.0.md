# Roadmap to 1.0

## Architecture Rewrite
* Flatten the AST to access everything by IDs
* Perform a pre-parsing step to get function definitions
* Perform scoping, typing, and parsing in the same step
* Pass up number of anonymous declarations / declarations to functions

### Memory Safety
* Garbage collection
* Array bounds checking

### Structure for built-in functions and types
* String functions
* IO functions
* DOM interaction?
* Javascript calling

### *Control Flow Graph*

### Low Level Representation

## Type System Extensions

### Parametric Polymorphism

### Typeclasses

### *Dynamic Types*

## Quality of Life

### Compiler Errors

### Debugger

### Testing

### Packaging
